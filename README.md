## Developer Description üë®‚Äçüíª

### Project Overview:

This project is a simple substitution cipher tool. It substitutes each character in the provided text with a corresponding character from a predefined substitution string, effectively encrypting or decrypting the text.

### Technology Used

- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS (for UI elements)

### File Structure:

- `script.js`: This file contains the core logic for the substitution cipher tool.
- `style.css`: This file provides very basic styling of the user interface.
- `index.html`: This file provides the user interface for the tool.

### Usage:

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Input your text in the provided text area, and click the "Encrypt/Decrypt" button.
4. The encrypted/decrypted text will be displayed below, which can be copied to the clipboard by clicking the "Copy" button.
5. The tool also keeps a history of the last 10 encryption/decryption actions, which can be cleared at any time using the "Clear History" button.

### Why was this created?

- To provide an example of a simple and intuitive interface for encrypting and decrypting text using a substitution cipher, as part of a classroom activity with primary school students.

### Project Overview:

This tool is a simple means to scramble text into a secret code, or decode such a secret code back into legible text, using a specific pattern of character replacement known as a "substitution cipher". It is aimed at K-12 students as an in-class activity.

### How it Works:

- You enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the provided box.
- Clicking a button, the tool scrambles or unscrambles the text according to a fixed pattern.
- The newly formed code, or deciphered text, is then displayed below for you to copy and use.
- The tool also keeps a track of your last 10 actions so you can refer back to them, which you can clear at any time.

### Why was this created?

- It is an essential step towards understanding and utilising basic encryption and decryption techniques to ensure data privacy and security.
